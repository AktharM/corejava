1) Platform independence:  many programing language like c,c++, they are platform dependent, where the code is written in particular Operating systems, and cannot run in any other operating system,
                          where java comes as platform independent where they code is written once and can excuite in any operating system.

2)Primitive Datatypes: The words start with lower case, they are 8 types of primitive datatypes
                       Example: int, float, boolean, char, double, byte, long, short 


 Non Primitve Datatypes: The words  start with upper case are non primitive datatypes 
  example: String, Class, System ...etc

3) class is the standard keyword in the java, withoutclass we cannot run the program.
 
5) class Arrays{
 public static void main (String a[]){
  
int[] valves={34, 78, 90, 53,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11}

}


} 

7) class Reverse{
 public static void main( String args[])
  {
 int number= 123456, reverse= 0;

  }

}      


8) class HourToSeconds
{
    public static void main (String a[])
    {
    int hour=5;
    int secounds=hour*60;
     System.out.println("secounds"+" "+secounds);
     }
}
